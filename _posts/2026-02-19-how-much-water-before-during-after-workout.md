# How Much Water to Drink When Training (Before, During, After)

Most people hydrate in one of two ways:
- they forget all day and chug at night
- they overthink it and still get it wrong

You don’t need a complicated plan. You need **simple numbers** you can actually follow.

---

## How much water should you drink before a workout?

A good default:
- **500 ml** in the **2 hours before training**

If it’s hot or you sweat a lot, add:
- **+200–300 ml** in the last 60 minutes

If you train early and can’t drink much, do the minimum:
- **300–500 ml** after waking, then go

---

## How much water should you drink during a workout?

It depends on session length and sweat.

### For a normal gym session (30–60 min)
- sip as needed
- don’t force it

### For longer sessions (60+ min) or very sweaty training (Muay Thai)
Aim for:
- **a few sips every 10–15 minutes**
- roughly **200–600 ml per hour** depending on heat and sweat

You don’t need a perfect target. The goal is to avoid leaving the session feeling wrecked.

---

## How much water should you drink after a workout?

A simple default:
- **500–750 ml** after training

If you’re drenched (shirt soaked, sweat dripping), go higher:
- **750–1000 ml** over the next 1–2 hours

### The “serious but simple” method (optional)
Weigh yourself before and after training:
- **1 kg lost ≈ 1 liter fluid deficit**

You don’t need to replace it instantly, but it tells you if you’re consistently under-drinking.

## Muay Thai hydration (practical version)

Muay Thai usually means sweat.

Use this:
- **500 ml** in the 2 hours before
- **sip during**
- **750 ml** after (more if you’re drenched)

If you finish Muay Thai with headaches/cramps:
- add **electrolytes** on those days

Electrolytes guide: <a href="/hydration/electrolytes-for-workouts/">Electrolytes for workouts</a>.

---

## Signs you didn’t drink enough (common and obvious)

- dark yellow urine after training
- headache after training
- cramps later that day/night
- unusually “flat” performance in the next session
- dry mouth that won’t go away

If these happen often, your hydration baseline is too low.

## Common mistakes (easy fixes)

### 1) Drinking everything at night
Fix: shift some water earlier. Morning + midday solves most issues.

### 2) Only drinking when thirsty during training
Thirst is fine, but if you’re already behind, thirst comes late. Fix baseline first.

### 3) Ignoring heat and sweat
Hot day + hard training = you need more. No debate.

## FAQ: water before/during/after training

### How much water should I drink before the gym?
A good baseline is **500 ml in the 2 hours before** training.

### Should I drink water during a workout?
Yes if you’re thirsty, and especially if the session is **60+ minutes** or very sweaty.

### How much water should I drink after a workout?
Most people do well with **500–750 ml**, more if the session was long/hot.
