# Muscle Soreness vs Injury: What’s Normal (DOMS) and What’s Not

Soreness after training is common. But not every “I’m sore” is normal.

This is the difference you actually need:
- **DOMS** = normal muscle soreness from training stress
- **Injury** = something you should not push through

If you train Muay Thai, lift, or do hard conditioning, you’ll meet both at some point. This guide helps you tell them apart fast.

## What is DOMS?

**DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness)** is the typical soreness that appears **after** training, not during it.

Common timeline:
- starts: **6–12 hours** after training
- peaks: **24–72 hours**
- fades: **2–5 days** (sometimes longer after a new stimulus)

DOMS is mostly about:
- new exercises
- higher volume
- eccentric work (lowering phase)
- unaccustomed kicking volume / checks in Muay Thai

## DOMS vs injury: the fastest way to tell

### Normal DOMS usually feels like:
- dull ache in the muscle
- stiffness that **improves once you warm up**
- soreness spread across an area (not one pinpoint spot)
- both sides can be sore (often symmetrical)
- you can move, it just feels “tight”

### Injury warning signs (red flags):
- **sharp pain**
- pain in one specific spot (pinpoint)
- swelling, bruising, heat
- pain that **gets worse** as you warm up
- limping or loss of strength
- pain in a joint (knee/ankle/shoulder) rather than muscle belly
- “pop” sensation during the movement

**Simple rule:**  
If it’s sharp, pinpoint, swollen, or worsening with movement — treat it as injury until proven otherwise.

## Soreness location matters

### DOMS tends to hit:
- quads after squats/lunges
- glutes/hamstrings after hinges (RDL, deadlift)
- calves after lots of footwork
- shoulders after pressing or high punching volume

### Injuries often show up as:
- knee pain under/around the kneecap
- Achilles pain (sharp, tendon area)
- shoulder pain at the front/top of the joint
- elbow pain (tendons), wrist pain (impact + overuse)

DOMS is usually “in the muscle”. Injuries are often “in the joint/tendon”.

## What to do if it’s DOMS (normal soreness)

DOMS isn’t something you “fix”. You manage it so it doesn’t ruin training.

### 1) Move, don’t rest completely
Light movement helps:
- easy walk 15–30 min
- light mobility
- easy shadowboxing / technique rounds

### 2) Keep the next session smart
If legs are trashed:
- do technique instead of hard conditioning
- reduce weight/volume in the gym
- avoid max effort

### 3) Sleep and hydration
Recovery basics aren’t sexy, but they work:
- sleep more than 6 hours
- hydrate (especially after sweaty sessions)

Hydration baseline: <a href="/hydration/">Hydration guides</a>.

### 4) Heat can help you feel better (not “heal faster”)
Sauna or hot shower can reduce stiffness perception. Practical guide:

## What to do if you suspect injury

Do not try to “earn” toughness points.

### Step 1: Stop the movement that triggers sharp pain
Don’t keep testing it.

### Step 2: Reduce load and range of motion
If you can move pain-free in a smaller range, that’s your starting point.

### Step 3: Use the 24–48 hour rule
If it gets worse over 24–48 hours, or you can’t train normally, take it seriously.

If there’s swelling, bruising, instability, numbness, or severe pain — that’s a medical check, not a blog problem.

---

## Common mistakes that turn soreness into injury

1) **Training hard on heavy DOMS**
2) **Adding volume too fast** (new sport + gym at the same time)
3) **Maxing out when technique is messy**
4) **Ignoring small joint pain** until it becomes big pain
5) **Never deloading** (a lighter week every 4–6 weeks is smart)

## FAQ: DOMS and injuries

### Is soreness after training good?
It’s not “good” or “bad”. It’s a signal you did something your body wasn’t used to. Progress can happen without soreness.

### Should I train when I’m sore?
Yes if it’s normal DOMS and you can move well — just reduce intensity/volume. No if it feels sharp or unstable.

### How long should DOMS last?
Typically 2–5 days. If pain is escalating or not improving at all, suspect injury.
