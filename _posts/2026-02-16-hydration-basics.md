# Hydration Basics: What Actually Matters

Hydration is simple. People make it complicated because it sells.

## The only rules you need
- **Drink consistently**, not in one huge dump at night.
- **Use urine color as a quick check** (pale yellow is usually fine).
- **If you train hard or sweat a lot, add electrolytes** sometimes — not every day.

## A practical starting point
Start with **2 liters/day**, then adjust:
- add more in heat
- add more when training
- add more if you’re drinking lots of caffeine

## Training days
On training days, aim for:
- **500 ml** in the 2 hours before training
- **sip during**
- **500–750 ml** after (more if you sweat heavily)

## Electrolytes: when they matter
They matter when:
- you sweat a lot
- it’s hot
- sessions are long
- you get headaches/cramps after training

Otherwise, water + normal food is enough.
