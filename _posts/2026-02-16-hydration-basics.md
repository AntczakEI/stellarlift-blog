# Hydration Basics: What Actually Matters

Most hydration advice is either **too vague** (“drink more water”) or **too dramatic** (“you’re chronically dehydrated”).  
Reality is boring — and that’s good. If you get a few basics right, you’ll feel better, train better, and stop overthinking water.

This guide is built for normal life **and** training. No gimmicks.

## How much water do you really need per day?

A solid baseline for most adults is:

- **2 liters/day** if you’re mostly indoors and not training
- **2.5–3.5 liters/day** if you train regularly, sweat a lot, or it’s hot

If you want a simple rule that actually scales with body size:

### The “30–35 ml per kg” rule (easy math)
Take your body weight in kg and multiply by **30–35 ml**.

Examples:
- 70 kg → **2.1–2.45 L/day**
- 90 kg → **2.7–3.15 L/day**

That’s **total fluids** you drink (mostly water). You also get some water from food, so don’t treat it like a strict law.

**Bottom line:** start with **2 L/day**, then adjust using the signals below.

## The only hydration signals you should care about

Hydration isn’t a vibe. Your body tells you what’s happening.

### 1) Urine color (fastest check)
Use this as your daily “dashboard”:

- **Pale straw / light yellow** → usually fine  
- **Clear all day** → you might be overdoing it (or just drank a lot recently)  
- **Dark yellow** → you’re likely behind  
- **Amber + strong smell** → you’re *definitely* behind  
- **Brown / tea-colored** → stop and take it seriously (dehydration or other issues)

You don’t need perfection. Just don’t live in the dark-yellow zone.

### 2) Thirst + dry mouth
Thirst is not a failure. It’s normal.  
But if you’re thirsty **all day**, you’re playing catch-up.

### 3) Headaches, cramps, “flat” workouts
If training feels unusually hard and you get:
- headaches
- cramps
- heavy legs / low energy  
…it’s often hydration + electrolytes (not always, but often).

---

## Drink consistently (the #1 rule people mess up)

This is the classic mistake:

> You drink almost nothing all day, then try to “fix it” at night.

That usually leads to:
- bloating
- worse sleep (night bathroom trips)
- still feeling dry the next day

### A simple daily pattern that works
You don’t need a schedule app. Just anchor drinks to moments:

- **Morning:** 300–500 ml within 60 minutes of waking  
- **Midday:** 500–800 ml between lunch and afternoon  
- **Evening:** top up, but don’t chug right before bed

If you do that, you’re already ahead of 90% of people.

## Hydration on training days (what to do before, during, after)

### Before training (2 hours)
Aim for:
- **500 ml** in the 2 hours before training  
- plus **another 200–300 ml** if it’s hot or you sweat a lot

### During training
You don’t need to micromanage.
- **Sip** if you’re thirsty  
- If the session is **60+ minutes**, sipping helps performance

### After training
A good default:
- **500–750 ml** after  
- more if you’re drenched or training was long/hot

If you want the “serious” version:
- weigh yourself before and after training  
- **each 1 kg lost ≈ 1 liter** fluid deficit  
You don’t need to replace it instantly, but it’s a clean signal.

## Do you need electrolytes?

Most people don’t need electrolytes every day.  
But they **do** matter in specific situations.

### Electrolytes help when:
- you sweat a lot (visible sweat, soaked shirt)
- it’s hot
- sessions are long (60–90+ minutes)
- you train 2x/day
- you get headaches/cramps after training
- you feel “wired but weak” (common when dehydrated)

### When electrolytes are usually unnecessary:
- normal day, light activity
- short gym session in cool conditions
- you eat normal meals (salt + potassium from food)

**Simple rule:**  
If you sweat a lot and performance drops, try electrolytes **on training days only** for a week and see if it improves.

## Common hydration mistakes (that ruin people quietly)

### 1) “Coffee counts so I’m fine”
Coffee does contribute fluid, but caffeine can also increase urination in some people.  
If you drink lots of caffeine, you usually need **more water**, not less.

### 2) Drinking huge amounts at once
You can’t outsmart biology.  
Chugging 1–2 liters doesn’t instantly hydrate you — it mostly increases bathroom trips.

### 3) Going low-salt while training hard
If you sweat a lot and avoid salt completely, you can feel:
- weak
- dizzy
- crampy  
Salt isn’t evil. Overdoing junk food is the issue.

### 4) “I don’t sweat so I’m not losing water”
You still lose water through breathing and skin — even in winter.

## A practical hydration plan you can follow (no tracking needed)

If you want a dead-simple plan:

1. Start at **2 liters/day**
2. Add **+500 ml** on training days
3. Add **+500–1000 ml** on hot days or heavy sweat days
4. Use urine color as the daily check
5. Use electrolytes **only** when sweat + performance says you need them

That’s it.

## Quick FAQ (Real answers)

### Is 2 liters of water a day enough?
For many people, yes — **as a baseline**. If you train, sweat heavily, or it’s hot, you’ll often need more.

### How do I know if I’m dehydrated?
The simplest signs: **dark urine**, frequent thirst, headaches, cramps, and unusually “flat” workouts.

### What’s the best time to drink water?
All day, but the best strategy is to **drink consistently** instead of trying to catch up at night.

### Do electrolytes hydrate you better than water?
They help when you’re losing a lot of salt through sweat. Otherwise, plain water + normal food is enough.

## The boring truth

Hydration is not a miracle lever.  
But when you fix it, you usually get:

- better energy
- fewer headaches
- better training sessions
- better recovery and sleep

You don’t need fancy rules. You need consistency.
