# Sweat Rate Calculator: Your Workout Hydration Plan (Water + Sodium per Hour)

Most hydration advice is useless because it’s generic.

You don’t need “drink more water.”  
You need one number:

**your sweat rate (liters per hour).**

Once you know it, you can build a plan that actually works for:
- normal **gym sessions**
- **hot gyms / conditioning**
- and yes — a **Muay Thai** version that fits round breaks without making you feel sick.

This is gym-first (more searches), but the method covers both.

## The 60-second idea

Your body weight drops during training mostly because you lose fluid (sweat + breathing).

So if you measure:
- weight before
- weight after
- and how much you drank

…you can estimate **how many liters per hour you’re losing**.

That’s your “hydration number.”

## Sweat Rate Calculator (step-by-step)

You need:
- a scale
- your bottle (so you know how much you drank)
- a note on time

### Step 1) Weigh in (before training)
- Weigh yourself **right before** you start
- Best: minimal clothing, dry skin
- Write it down (kg)

### Step 2) Track what you drink
- Note total fluids during the session  
  Example: 750 ml = **0.75 L**

### Step 3) Weigh out (after training)
- Towel off sweat first (don’t weigh a wet shirt)
- Weigh again (kg)

### Step 4) Calculate sweat loss
Use:

**Sweat loss (L) = (weight before − weight after) + fluids drank − urine**

Notes:
- **1 kg ≈ 1 liter**
- If you didn’t pee during the session, urine = **0**

### Step 5) Convert to liters per hour
**Sweat rate (L/h) = sweat loss (L) ÷ duration (hours)**

---

## Example (gym session)

- Weight before: **87.0 kg**
- Weight after: **86.2 kg**
- Fluids: **0.60 L**
- Duration: **75 min = 1.25 h**
- Urine: **0**

**Sweat loss = (87.0 − 86.2) + 0.60 = 0.8 + 0.60 = 1.40 L**  
**Sweat rate = 1.40 ÷ 1.25 = 1.12 L/h**

So in these conditions you’re losing about **1.1 liters per hour**.

That’s a high-sweat session — and now you can plan it.

---

## Turn sweat rate into a drinking plan (simple + safe)

During training, the goal is usually **not** to replace 100% instantly.

A practical starting point:

- **Target intake = ~60–80% of your sweat rate**
- Keep it within what your stomach tolerates
- **Don’t consistently drink more than you lose**

Many guidelines land typical “during exercise” intake around **~0.4–0.8 L/h** for a lot of people (but your sweat rate can be outside that range). Your test tells you where you are.

### Using the example (1.12 L/h)
- 60–80% = **0.67–0.90 L/h**
- Choose something you can execute: **0.75 L/h**

Now it’s actionable.

## Gym plan (strength / hypertrophy)

In the gym you want hydration that:
- doesn’t bloat you
- doesn’t interrupt sets
- is easy to follow

### Easy rule
**150–250 ml every 15–20 minutes**

That gives you:
- ~**0.45–1.0 L/h** depending on your needs

### Quick templates
**45–60 min workout**
- If you sweat moderately: **300–600 ml total**
- If you sweat a lot / hot gym: **500–800 ml total**

**75–90 min workout**
- Typical target: **0.5–0.8 L/h**
- If your sweat rate is high: push toward the upper end **only if your stomach tolerates it**

---

## Muay Thai version (between rounds, without feeling sick)

Muay Thai tends to be:
- more continuous movement
- more heat
- more sweat
- and drinking at the wrong time can cause nausea

So the **math is the same**, but the execution changes:

### Between-round rule
Instead of constant sipping:
- take **100–200 ml** in short repeats between rounds
- avoid chugging huge amounts at once

If your measured sweat rate is high (1.2+ L/h in hot rooms happens), you still don’t want to slam a full bottle mid-session.

**Small repeats beat big chugs.**

---

## Sodium: when it matters (and how to calculate it)

If you train **longer than ~1 hour** and sweat heavily, sodium becomes more relevant.

A practical sodium target often used in guidance for longer exercise is:

**~500–700 mg sodium per liter** (0.5–0.7 g/L)

### Sodium math (the part most people skip)
If you drink **0.75 L/h** and aim for **500–700 mg/L**:

- 0.75 × 500 = **375 mg sodium/hour**
- 0.75 × 700 = **525 mg sodium/hour**

So a clean range is roughly:
**~400–500 mg sodium per hour** (for long, sweaty sessions)

### What this means in real life
- Sports drinks vary a lot
- Electrolyte tablets vary a lot

Read labels and use sodium **when it actually fits the session**:
- long session (60–90+ minutes)
- heavy sweat / hot room
- salty sweat marks on clothes/skin
- headaches/cramps when you only drink plain water

---

## The biggest mistake: drinking more than you lose

More water isn’t always better.

A simple safety rule:
**Don’t consistently drink more than your sweat loss.**

If your test shows you lose ~1.0 L/h and you’re drinking 1.5 L/h, that’s a red flag.

### Signs you’re overdoing it
- sloshing stomach / nausea
- swollen fingers
- headache + confusion after heavy drinking
- frequent clear urination mid-session

---

## Quick 3-line setup (copy/paste logic)

1) Measure your **sweat rate (L/h)**  
2) Drink **~60–80%** of that (start simple)  
3) If **>1 hour + heavy sweat**, add sodium **~500–700 mg/L**

That’s your plan.
