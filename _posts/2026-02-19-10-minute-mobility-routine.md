# 10-Minute Mobility Routine: Daily Reset for Hips, Ankles, and Upper Back

Most people don’t need a 45-minute mobility session.  
They need a **10-minute reset** they actually do.

This routine targets the three areas that matter most for gym + Muay Thai:
- **hips** (kicks, squats, posture)
- **ankles** (footwork, knee tracking, balance)
- **upper back / shoulders** (punching volume, posture)

Do it:
- daily, or
- after training, or
- on rest days

No equipment needed (optional band is nice).

## How to use this routine

Pick one:
- **Daily** (best): once per day, anytime
- **After training**: reduces stiffness and helps you downshift
- **Before training**: do it faster, treat it as a warm-up

Rule: nothing should be painful. Mild stretch and tension is fine.

## The 10-minute routine (timer-friendly)

### 1) Ankles: knee-to-wall rocks (2 minutes)
- Stand facing a wall, foot flat
- Drive knee forward toward the wall without lifting the heel
- 10–15 reps per side, slow

Why: better ankle mobility = better squats, better footwork, happier knees.

---

### 2) Hips: 90/90 switches (2 minutes)
- Sit in 90/90 position
- Switch sides under control
- 8–12 slow switches

If it’s too hard:
- use hands for support
- reduce range

Why: hips get locked from sitting, lifting, and repetitive kicking patterns.

---

### 3) Hip flexor + glute: half-kneeling stretch (2 minutes)
- Half-kneeling, squeeze glute of the back leg
- Slight pelvic tuck (don’t arch lower back)
- Hold 30–45 sec each side, then repeat quickly

Why: tight hip flexors mess with posture, low back, and kick mechanics.

---

### 4) Upper back: thoracic rotations (2 minutes)
- On all fours, one hand behind head
- Rotate elbow toward ceiling, then back down
- 6–10 reps each side

Why: better thoracic rotation helps punching, breathing, and posture.

---

### 5) Shoulders: wall slides or scap push-ups (2 minutes)

Option A: **Wall slides**
- Back to wall, ribs down
- Slide arms up slowly, 8–12 reps

Option B: **Scap push-ups**
- Push-up position (knees ok)
- Keep elbows straight, move shoulder blades only
- 10–15 reps

Why: shoulder health matters if you punch a lot or press in the gym.

---

## If you have 2 extra minutes (optional finisher)

- **Deep squat hold**: 45–60 sec (heels down if possible)
- **Calf stretch**: 30 sec per side

## Common mistakes

### 1) Going too hard
Mobility isn’t punishment. If you’re shaking and cramping, you’ll avoid it tomorrow.

### 2) Doing it once a week
Once a week feels good, but daily short sessions change your baseline.

### 3) Ignoring recovery basics
Mobility helps, but sleep and hydration still run the show.

## FAQ: mobility routine

### Should I do mobility before or after training?
Both work. Before training: faster and lighter. After training: slower and more relaxing.

### How long until I feel a difference?
Usually within 1–2 weeks if you do it most days.

### Do I need stretching if I lift weights?
Yes, but “a little often” beats “a lot rarely”. This routine is enough for most people.
